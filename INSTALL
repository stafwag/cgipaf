NOTE

    Please make a backup of your password files ( /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, 
    /etc/oshadow ) before you try this program.

SUPPORTED SYSTEMS

    cgipaf has been tested with Debian GNU/Linux (potato and woody) and
    Solaris 8 and should work on other Un*ces with pam support. Systems
    without pam support are only supported if they use the standard  
    password file location /etc/passwd /etc/shadow and the standard crypt
    function to encrypt the password. For this reason OpenBSD isn't supported.

    If you're using cgipaf on a system without pam support a lock file
    /var/lock/cgipasswd.lock is used. The directory /var/lock have to exist
    on our system or you can modify pass.h to your own needs.

    cgipasswd depends on the ndbm or compatible library. The GNU dbm library
    is also supported and is automaticaly detected by configure.

INSTALLATION

    type: 

          ./configure --bindir=/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin \ 
                      --datadir=/usr/local/apache/htdocs/cgipasswd \ 
                      --sysconfdir=/etc/cgipaf
    
    Update the above command with your real cgi-bin and htdocs directory

    This will create Makefile, install.sh and config.h
    
    If you want to disable pam support you can add "--disable-pam" 
    configure should normally detect pam and no-pam systems.
          
    type: 
          make
    
    To compile the sources.

    type: make install
    
    The installation script will install "passwd.cgi","viewmailcfg.cgi" and 
    "mailcfg.cgi" in cgi-bin, copy "php/*.php" in the htdocs directory, and 
    create a sample config file. 
    
    "passwd.cgi", "viewmailcfg.cgi", "mailcfg.cgi"  should have the following 
    permissions:
    
    -r-sr-xr-x    1 root     root        33391 Aug 10 22:16 mailcfg.cgi
    -r-sr-xr-x    1 root     root        30333 Aug 10 22:16 passwd.cgi
    -r-sr-xr-x    1 root     root        34658 Aug 10 22:16 viewmailcfg.cgi

    and owned by root.
