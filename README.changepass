       cchhaannggeeppaassss  is  a  chpasswd clone, it might be useful on platforms that
       doesn't have such a command like Solaris.
       Most GNU/Linux distributions have chpasswd (8), on FreeBSD you can  use
       "pw  usermod  name  -h  0" but many commercial Un*ces doesn't have tool
       like this.  An alternative is to update the user's password  in  script
       with uusseerrmmoodd
       but  it's  possible  to see the encrypted password in the process list,
       which is not very secure.
       cchhaannggeeppaassss reads a list of user name and password pairs from ssttddiinn  and
       updates the users passwords
       Each line has format:
       username:password
