OVERVIEW

    cgipaf is a combination of three cgi programs:
    
         passwd.cgi:       allow users to update their password
	 viewmailcfg.cgi:  allow users to view their current mail 
	                   configuration.
	 mailcfg.cgi:      update the mail configuration
	 
    All programs use PAM for user authentication, systems without PAM
    are only supported if they use the standard password file location
    (/etc/passwd /etc/shadow) and the standard crypt function to encrypt
    the passwords.
    
    If a password is changed it is possible to run a script to update
    SAMBA passwords, NIS configuration, etc.
	 
    The mail configuration is done by procmail by default, mailcfg.cgi 
    creates a .procmailrc in the user's home directory. If autoreply is 
    enabled the autoreply message is stored in ~/vacations.txt. When a user 
    enables mail forwarding the user can choose to keep the messages.
    
    If you want to use another auto responder like vacation you can define
    an external script to update the user's mail configuration. See examples
    for an example config.
    
    For user authentication viewmailcfg.cgi creates a cookie, this cookie 
    is stored in the accessdb. mailcfg.cgi reads the cookie out the accessdb 
    and compares it with the cookie send by the users browser.
    
    User with too many invalid logins can be locked.
    
    The minimum and maximum uid can be set in the configuration file, so
    you can specify a range of uid's that are allowed to use cgipaf.
  
    You can specify html files with a few PHP extensions for the login screen
    and error messages.
    
    It's possible to use a redirect for the error messages, instead of plain 
    html files.
